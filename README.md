# ControlFlowUtils
Custom nodes for ComfyUI to enable flow control with advanced loops, conditional branching, logic operations and several other nifty utilities to enhance your ComfyUI workflows.

[ v0.0.2 Just Released - Nodes are fully documented inside ComfyUI. Documentation should be added to the Github tomorrow. ]

DOCUMENTATION WILL BE ADDED SOON, FOR NOW, PLEASE HAVE A LOOK AT THE INCLUDED SAMPLE WORKFLOWS.

NOTE: In order to use the RAM cleaning functionality of the Garbage Collector node, place the exe from this repo https://github.com/IgorMundstein/WinMemoryCleaner into your ComfyUI main directory (currently Windows only).
